- Supported OS : Windows | Mac OS

The `Pulse Secure NTUVPN` will only support up to 400 concurrent users from 1 June 2020. Staff that continue to use `Pulse Secure NTUVPN` will encounter slowness, and intermittent “deny access” when the concurrent sessions count is exceeded.

Everyone is encouraged to use the new VPN (`Zscaler`) to work remotely to enjoy smoother experience, access, and performance.
