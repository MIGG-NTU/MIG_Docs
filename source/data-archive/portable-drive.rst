We use portable drives to store some research data and resources.

Several portable drives are used to store continuous seismic waveform data.
See the GitHub repository `SeisData_EOS <https://github.com/MIGG-NTU/SeisData_EOS>`__ for details.

Some MIG member's data are backuped in some portable drives:

- ``Shaolin.tar.gz`` in MIG NO.3 portable drive is Shaolin Liu's workstation backup.
  We need to check with him when he comes back to NTU next time.
- ``Yao-Jiayuan.tar.gz`` in MIG NO.3 portable drive is Jiayuan Yao's workstation backup.
  We can delete when he is okay to do it.

Prof. Tong gave each person below a 4 TB portable drive to backup their data:

- Shucheng Wu
- Shijie Hao
- Tianjue Li
