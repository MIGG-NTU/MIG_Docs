We use portable drives to store some research data and resources.

A 8 TB protable drive called **MIG-8T** (`ext4` format and WD My Book) is used to store data:

- ``Cheng-YauWing-06112019.tar.gz``: IMPORTANT DATASET!!! Yau Wing Cheng's data.
- ``Shaolin.tar.gz``: Shaolin Liu's workstation backup.
  We need to check with him when he comes back to NTU next time.
- Common data: See `SeisData_EOS <https://github.com/MIGG-NTU/SeisData_EOS>`__ for more information.

We also have a few 4 TB portable drives to store common data, e.g., EOS-tectonics and EOS-volcano.
See `SeisData_EOS <https://github.com/MIGG-NTU/SeisData_EOS>`__ for more information.

Besides, Prof. Tong gave each person below a 4 TB portable drive to backup their data:

- Shucheng Wu
- Shijie Hao
- Tianjue Li
