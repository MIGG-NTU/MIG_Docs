We use portable drives to store some research data and resources.

Several portable drives are used to store continuous seismic waveform data.
See the GitHub repository `SeisData_EOS <https://github.com/MIGG-NTU/SeisData_EOS>`__ for details.

Besides, we backup some files in some of those portable drives:

- ``Shaolin.tar.gz`` in a 8 TB portable drive called **MIG-8T**:
  Shaolin Liu's workstation backup. We need to check with him when he comes back to NTU next time.

Prof. Tong gave each person below a 4 TB portable drive to backup their data:

- Shucheng Wu
- Shijie Hao
- Tianjue Li
