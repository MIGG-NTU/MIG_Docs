Research Data at NTU
====================

If you are submitting your paper to a journal with a *data sharing requirement*, then you’ll be asked to provide a data availability statement. `DR-NTU (Data) <https://researchdata.ntu.edu.sg/>`_ provides Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for dataset, which you can use for *data availability statement*. Therefore, we can use DR-NTU (Data) to deposit, archive and share research data.


What is data availability statement
-----------------------------------

A data availability statement tells the reader where the underlying data for a research paper is available, typically with links to the data.


How to write a data availability statement
------------------------------------------

Some publishers (e.g. SpringerNature, Wiley) provide data availability statement templates for authors to use.

Here is an example of a simple data availability statement:
“The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in [repository name] at [doi]”

If you deposit your data in DR-NTU (Data), get the DOI from your dataset. The data availability statement would be something like this:
    *The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in NTU research data repository DR-NTU (Data) at https://doi.org/10.21979/N9/1CRLCJ*


Examples
--------

Depending on your journal’s guidelines, you can give your data availability statement to your journal as soon as your paper has been accepted, or earlier. You can give the DOI for the statement, even when your dataset is still unpublished. Just remember to publish your dataset no later than the publication date of your paper, so that the DOI will link properly. If the journal (and/or peer reviewer) would like to view the unpublished dataset first, you could share with them `a private URL <http://libfaq.ntu.edu.sg/faq/261770>`_.

Examples of paper publications with data availability statement:

- `Example 1 <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214482#abstract0>`_ from PLOS ONE
- `Example 2 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11251-4#data-availability>`_ from Nature Communications
