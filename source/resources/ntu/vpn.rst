- Supported OS : ``Windows`` | ``Mac OS``

The ``Pulse Secure NTUVPN`` will only support up to 400 concurrent users from 1 June 2020. Staff that continue to use ``Pulse Secure NTUVPN`` will encounter slowness, and intermittent “deny access” when the concurrent sessions count is exceeded.

Everyone is encouraged to use the new VPN (``Zscaler``) to work remotely to enjoy smoother experience, access, and performance.
