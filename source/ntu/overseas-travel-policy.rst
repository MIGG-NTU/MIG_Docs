Overseas business travel policy
===============================

:contributors: |Yao Jiayuan|
:last updating date: 2021-05-22

----

The policy is going to be updated from ``1 August 2019``.
This policy was first established in April 2010 and updated in May 2015.
We are also taking this opportunity to improve claims and streamline administrative process
and reduce high compliance cost due to complex computation of subsistence allowance.
The link to the revised policy is `Business Travel <https://ts.ntu.edu.sg/sites/policyportal/new/Policies2/HumanResource/Pages/BusinessTravel.aspx>`_

Overseas Travel Claims
----------------------

From 1 August 2019, we will be removing the options to select method of claims for all overseas trips for business purposes.
All travels made on or after 1 August 2019 will be a combination of allowance and reimbursement basis.

The allowance (“Overseas daily allowance”) is a per diem allowance based on Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) rates and includes
meals, local transport and incidental expenses (refer to Annex A for a list of countries and applicable rates).

Expenses that do not fall under the allowance and will be reimbursed as incurred include:

- Overseas accommodation (subject to a cap per Annex B)
- Overseas airport transfer
- Travelling expenses between cities for business purpose
- Entertainment expenses for business purpose

Overseas Daily Allowance (currently known as Subsistence Allowance)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The current allowance computation is complex and dependent on the length of time at place of duty. We have simplified allowance claimable as follows:

**EFFECTIVE from 1 AUG 2019**

=================================== ===========================================
Total Duration at Place of Duty     Percentage of Overseas Daily Allowance Rate
=================================== ===========================================
Up to 14 days                       100%
More than 14 days but up to 31 days 75%
=================================== ===========================================

Additional key policy items
---------------------------

- Travel Class entitlement for Non-Resident Professionals
- Principal Investigators’ responsibility
- Meal claims for travellers in transit
