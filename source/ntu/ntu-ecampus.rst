`NTU eCampus <https://intu.ntu.edu.sg>`__ is a commonly-used web service at NTU
for staff and faculty. Some examples are listed below.

- ``StaffLink``: a lot of useful links for NTU staff. Now we can use ``Workday@NTU`` instead.
- ``ServiceNow@NTU`` : we can query almost all the issues using it.
- ``ServiceNow@NTU`` -> ``Workday@NTU``: Our personal information, ask for leave etc. You can also download ``Workday`` app on your phone. A lot of personal things can be found in the following places.

    - Click on your profile picture (top right corner) > View Profile
    - Click on your profile picture > View Profile > Click on Action

- ``ServiceNow@NTU`` -> ``Request for Services`` -> ``Campus Services`` -> ``Facilities & Booking``: e.g., Lecture Theatres/Tutorial Rooms/Labs Booking, Faculty House Booking
- ``NTULearn``. Now NTULearn is actually Learning at Workday@NTU.
