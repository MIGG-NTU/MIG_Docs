The non-open codes/software used in MIG mainly comes from two sources:
(1) those developped by MIG; (2) those requested from other scientists/institutions.
We should be very careful when we want or be asked to share codes/software:

1.  For the first kind of codes/softare

    We **CAN ONLY** share the codes/softare to other researchers when the
    permission from Prof. Tong Ping **IS** obtained. Meanwhile, the applicants
    **SHOULD** be noted by the codes/softare :download:`LICENSE.txt`.

2.  For the second kind of codes/softare

    We **ONLY HAVE** the right to use the codes/softare, while we **DON'T HAVE**
    the right to share them to other researchers.
