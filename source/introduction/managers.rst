Common Notes
------------

- We should have at least two managers for each task, so that if one leaves NTU suddently,
  another can still work with MIGG daily things.
- MIGG email (ntuimaging@gmail.com) is used to send a notice to all MIGG members.
  Please don't use this email to send an email to some MIGG members.
  We should use our own email in this case.
- We'd better forward a copy of incoming MIGG email to at least one manager's
  private email, so that we can know any issue or question in time.
- If we use Google Chrome, we can use the extension **Markdown Here**.
  Therefore, we can use Markdown language to write email,
  and then convert the text by click the extension button.
- Google Drive

  - The Google Drive only has 15GB. We only use it to store non-open materials
    or large files that are not suitable to be put in GitHub.
    Other better method for sharing public data may be found in the future.
  - MIGG public and private data are put in ``MIGG-materials``.
    ``Right-click it`` -> ``Get shareable link`` -> ``click sharing settings``.
    We can click ``top-right button (Share with people setting)`` to determine
    if *Editors can change permissions and share*.
    We can also click ``bottom-left button (Change)`` to determine if anyone
    with the link is a ``viewer`` or ``editor``.
    For file safety, we must set it to be ``viewer``.
  - We can also only share some directories in ``MIGG-materials``. The method is the same.
  - If you add new file folders, please also modify the corresponding content in the :doc:`/data-archive/google-drive`.

Routine Managers
----------------

A new MIGG member is defined as one of the following cases
(note that the **only** condition depends on Prof. Tong):

- Prof. Tong adds him/her into our WeChat group
- Prof. Tong formally notices us (in WeChat and groupmeeintg etc.)
  that someone has accepted the offer (e.g., master, Ph.D., postdoc etc.)
  or someone decides to visit us (e.g., visiting student/professor etc.)

Before the new member arrives NTU

- Please send him/her an email about some basic information about MIGG and
  **cc to Prof. TONG**. A template email is shown below.

    Hi XX,

    There are four websites related to our group now.

    3. https://github.com/MIGG-NTU/ (MIG GitHub)

    Some MIGG internal materials are available in MIGG Google Drive： xxx
    (replaced xxx with real share link of ``MIGG-materials``)

    If you have any useful materials and information, we will be appreciated that you can share with us.
    For example, your thesis (pdf & ppt), books, softwares, your experiences etc.

    If you have any suggestions about our websites or other things, please feel free to discuss with the managers.

Groupmeeting Managers
---------------------

Arrangement
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    We now use :doc:`GitHub </group-meeting/index>` to record group meeting and
    :doc:`/data-archive/google-drive` to store ppts instead of https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/geophysics/.
    The old group meeting website (https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/geophysics/)
    has no longer been maintained since 2021/05/11.
    We still keep the :doc:`/ntu/ntu-blog/index` to learn how to manage the old
    MIG groupmeeting website.

- Please check Pulic Holidays before arranging a group meeting.
  Please refer to `NTU Academic Calendar <https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sasd/oas/AcademicCalendar/Pages/index.aspx>`_.
- Please refer to :doc:`/ntu/room-booking/index` to help Prof.
  TONG with tutorial room booking. If you have no access, please ask other members help you.
- Please remind the reporter to send ppt to the manager after the presentation,
  so that MIGG members can download the ppt after groupmeeting.
- Please always remember to update :doc:`/group-meeting/paper-reading`.
- Please upload ppt to ``groupmeeting.ntu`` in MIGG Google Drive if ppt is available.
  Paper pdfs are not needed to upload there due to the space limit.

Notice
^^^^^^^

- Please remind the reporter to send clear pdfs without notes,
  a three-sentence-long topic summary (so that everyone can know the content),
  & paper citation at least **two weeks before** his/her presetation.
  The citation can be archived from google scholar, e.g.,

    Cheng, C., Bodin, T., & Allen, R. M. (2016). Three-dimensional pre-stack depth migration of receiver functions with the fast marching method: a Kirchhoff approach. Geophysical Journal International, 205(2), 819-829.

- Our paper reading notice email also needs to cc to Prof. Shengji Wei's group members.
  We can click **reply to all** in their paper reading notice email,
  and then copy all the email addresses including the sender's email.
  We can then group their emails as **EOS_Prof.Wei** in our MIGG email **Contacts**
  (click the top-right nine dots -> Contacts).
  Please notice their email list may be updated at some time,
  so please remember to delete previous email addresses and add new email addresses.
