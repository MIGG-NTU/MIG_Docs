Overseas business travel policy
===============================

The policy is going to be updated from ``1 August 2019``. This policy was first established in April 2010 and updated in May 2015. We are also taking this opportunity to improve claims and streamline administrative process and reduce high compliance cost due to complex computation of subsistence allowance.  The link to the revised policy is `Business Travel <https://ts.ntu.edu.sg/sites/policyportal/new/Policies2/HumanResource/Pages/BusinessTravel.aspx>`_


Overseas Travel Claims
----------------------

From 1 August 2019, we will be removing the options to select method of claims for all overseas trips for business purposes. All travels made on or after 1 August 2019 will be a combination of allowance and reimbursement basis.

The allowance (“Overseas daily allowance”) is a per diem allowance based on Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) rates and includes:

- Meals, local transport and incidental expenses (refer to Annex A for a list of countries and applicable rates)

Expenses that do not fall under the allowance and will be reimbursed as incurred include:

- Overseas accommodation (subject to a cap per Annex B)
- Overseas airport transfer
- Travelling expenses between cities for business purpose
- Entertainment expenses for business purpose


Overseas Daily Allowance (currently known as Subsistence Allowance)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The current allowance computation is complex and dependent on the length of time at place of duty. We have simplified allowance claimable as follows:

**EFFECTIVE from 1 AUG 2019**

=================================== ===========================================
Total Duration at Place of Duty     Percentage of Overseas Daily Allowance Rate
=================================== ===========================================
Up to 14 days                       100%
More than 14 days but up to 31 days 75%
=================================== ===========================================

- Principal Investigators’ responsibility
- Meal claims for travellers in transit

- Reminder: Business travel application and approval must be obtained **prior** to departure. If for some reasons, requestor is not able to apply or obtain approval via BTS in time, he/she needs to seek approval via email **before** departure. ``Staff that fails to do so might risk not able to get reimbursed``. The Office of Finance has arranged for travel insurance coverage under the University's Group Travel Insurance Policy. ``Staff will not be covered by travel insurance if his/her travel application request is not approved prior to departure.``
