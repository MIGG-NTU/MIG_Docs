MIG Manager and Member Notes
============================

Common Notes for Managers
-------------------------

- We should have at least two managers for each task, so that if one leaves NTU suddently, another can still work with MIGG daily things.

- MIGG email (ntuimaging@gmail.com) is used to send a notice to all MIGG members. Please don't use this email to send an email to some MIGG members. We should use our own email in this case.

- We'd better forward a copy of incoming MIGG email to at least one manager's private email, so that we can know any issue or question in time.

- If we use Google Chrome, we can use the extension **Markdown Here**. Therefore, we can use Markdown language to write email, and then convert the text by click the extension button.

- Google Drive
    - The Google Drive only has 15GB. We only use it to store non-open materials or large files that are not suitable to be put in GitHub. Other better method for sharing public data may be found in the future.
    - MIGG public and private data are put in ``MIGG-materials``. ``Right-click it`` -> ``Get shareable link`` -> ``click sharing settings``. We can click ``top-right button (Share with people setting)`` to determine if *Editors can change permissions and share*. We can also click ``bottom-left button (Change)`` to determine if anyone with the link is a ``viewer`` or ``editor``. For file safety, we must set it to be ``viewer``.
    - We can also only share some directories in ``MIGG-materials``. The method is the same.
    - If you add new file folders, please also modify the corresponding content in the :doc:`/resources-migg/google-drive`.


MIG Routine Managers

A new MIGG member is defined as one of the following cases (note that the **only** condition depends on Prof. Tong):
