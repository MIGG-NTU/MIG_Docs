Sometimes we need to book Lecture Theatres/Tutorial Rooms/Labs, and NTU provides such a service.
Only a staff or faculty can use this system.
Let's talk about how to book a tutorial room at SPMS as an example.
Follow the following stream to go into the booking system:

- ``ServiceNow@NTU`` -> ``Request for Services`` -> ``Campus Services`` -> ``Facilities & Booking`` -> ``Lecture Theatres/Tutorial Rooms/Labs``
- Choose ``SPMS Facilities and Experiment Booking System`` or Other
