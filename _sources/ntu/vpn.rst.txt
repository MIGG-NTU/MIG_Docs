NTU provides use `VPN <https://ntuvpn.ntu.edu.sg/dana/home/index.cgi>`__, which supports Windows and macOS.

Everyone is encouraged to use the new VPN (``Zscaler``) to work remotely to enjoy smoother experience, access, and performance.
The ``Pulse Secure NTUVPN`` will only support up to 400 concurrent users from 1 June 2020.
Staff that continue to use ``Pulse Secure NTUVPN`` will encounter slowness,
and intermittent “deny access” when the concurrent sessions count is exceeded.
